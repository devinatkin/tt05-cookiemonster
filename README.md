Chat GPTs interpretation of this terrible project. Don't look to this for inspiration it's almost deliberately a series of bad ideas. 

🍪 CookieMonster: A Deliciously Unconventional Movable Feast Machine
Cookie Monster from Sesame Street saying 'Me want cookie'

"In the beginning, there were only a handful of cookies. And then came CookieMonster, a Movable Feast Machine implementation that devoured computational challenges just like Cookie Monster devours cookies!" - A Famous EE Scholar Who Totally Exists

🤔 What's Cooking?
CookieMonster is an experimental attempt to implement a version of the Movable Feast Machine (MFM) that's not just performant, but also as charming as its Sesame Street namesake. The MFM is a computational architecture aimed at building robust and adaptive systems. Unlike traditional architectures that crumble when you throw a chocolate chip curveball at them, MFM (and CookieMonster) adapt and thrive.

🍪 Features
Robust Architecture: CookieMonster takes robustness to the next level, just like its edible inspirations.
Adaptive Logic: Capable of dynamic reconfiguration, making it resilient against "cookie-crumbling" errors.
Parallel Execution: The more, the merrier! CookieMonster can munch through parallel tasks effortlessly.
🛠 Installation
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cookiemonster.git
cd cookiemonster
make install
🚀 Usage
To run the CookieMonster MFM, simply execute:

bash
Copy code
cookiemonster --devour computational_problem.json
📖 Documentation
Please refer to the detailed Wiki for extensive documentation, API reference, and mouth-watering cookie recipes.
